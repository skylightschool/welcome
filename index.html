            <h3>Grade-level Learning</h3>
            <p> If students are below grade level, they will be given scaffolding support and/or push-in or pull-out interventions as needed. Students at will receive an education that meets grade level expectations. </p>

            <h3>Portfolios</h3>
            <p> Portfolio assessment enables measuring high-level skills with meaningful and realistic activities for students instead of measuring low-level skills in a limited-time, using multi assessment methods instead of using only one measurement method, making assessment not sometimes but continuously, and determining the student’s weaknesses and strengths. </p>

            <h3>Integrated Studies&nbsp;</h3>
            <p> Integrated curriculum allows students to apply skills to new materials, to retrieve information more rapidly, to discern multiple perspectives, and to encourage greater depth and breadth in learning. Student attitudes toward comprehensive, integrated curriculum approaches are far more positive than to traditional instructional methods.</p>

Indirect academic outcomes were also measured with social development surfacing most frequently and positively.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Confronting Discrimination</h3>
            <p> Because discrimination operates in institutionalized and historicized ways as well, students and teachers will understand those forms of racism and will have the language to describe them as well. To confront racism in a free and open discussion, students and teachers will develop assertiveness, listening skills, group problem-solving skills, and effective strategies for conflict resolution.</p>

            <h3>Accessible Learning</h3>
            <p> The foundational instructional approach will center on the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP), which is designed for the needs of English Language Learners but is effective for native English speakers as well. All teachers will be trained and evaluated on their use of SIOP methods.</p>
